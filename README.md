# Interest-Bearing-Escrow

### Problem

The internet is a _wild_ place. Yet, it's great to make long-lasting connections with skilled people and build revolutionary projects. There's multiple services to ensure good faith from parties when exchanging on the net and they charge a hefty fee for it, some up to 20% of your revenue.

### Solution

Cut the intermediary and empower the parties with a decentralized escrow service. As a receiver, you benefit from receiving 100% of the payment. As a depositor, you benefit from your money yielding interest instead of being locked up collecting dust.

### Gas Optimizations

- clone factory instead of regular factory
